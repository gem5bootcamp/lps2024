## First step: Install SST

We're not going to do this today.

What we'll do instead is use a docker container with sst installed.

Run the following to go into the docker container.
Note: You shouldn't use a container interactively like this, but I'm lazy.

```sh
cd /workspaces/2024
docker run --rm --volume
/workspaces/:/workspaces -w `pwd` ghcr.io/gem5/sst-env
```

## gem5 as a Library: Hello, World!

To use gem5 as a "component" in SST, you need to build it as a library.
This is yet another unique build target...
Note: if you're building on a Mac, it's not ".so" it's ".dynlib"

Compiling gem5 as a library

```bash
cd gem5/
scons defconfig build/for_sst build_opts/RISCV
scons build/for_sst/libgem5_opt.so -j8 --without-tcmalloc --duplicate-sources
```

---

## Building the gem5 component in gem5

Compiling gem5 component

```bash
cd ext/sst
cp Makefile.linux Makefile
```

Change the line with `ARCH=RISCV` to `ARCH=for_sst`

```sh
make -j8
```

Running the simulation,

```bash
sst --add-lib-path=. sst/example.py
```

## gem5 as a Library

How to set up gem5 in another simulator?

* Step 1: Setting up the gem5 Python environment.
    * Need to manually import the m5 module
* Step 2: Reading the gem5 Python system configuration file.
    * This includes setting up the communication data path for gem5 and the other simulator


* Notes:
    * `m5.instantiate()` must be called before any simulation.
    * `m5.simulate(K)` runs the gem5 simulation for `K` ticks.

## gem5 as a Library: simulation

For every external simulator clock tick:

```python
external_simulator.advance_to_next_event()
gem5_system.advance(n_ticks)
```

where `n_ticks =` time difference between this event and previous event of the external simulator

## Case study: gem5/SST integration

SST: Structural Simulation Toolkit
http://sst-simulator.org/

* A highly parallelized discrete event simulator.
* Consists of:
    * SST-Core (the simulator)
    * SST-Elements (components)
    * SST-Macro

---

## SST: Brief Overview

* Simulation objects:
    * SST::Component (similar to gem5::SimObject)
    * SST::Link (allows two components to send SST::Event to each other)
        * Bidirectional
    * SST::Event (similar to gem5::Event)
        * Sent via SST::Link

* Parallelization,
    * SST partitions components to multiple partitions.
    * Communication between partitions are done via MPI.
    * The partitioning process can be done automatically or manually

## gem5/SST Integration

* gem5 provides:
    * OutgoingRequestBridge: a Request port sending requests to external components.
    * SSTResponderInterface: an interface for a Response port for an external component.
* gem5 Component is an SST::Component, which has multiple SSTResponder's implementing the SSTReponderInterface.
* The packet translation happens within the gem5 Component.

## gem5/SST Integration

* Example (arm and RISC-V):
    * gem5 as an SST component: gem5/ext/sst/
    * SST system configuration: gem5/ext/sst/sst/example.py
    * gem5 system configuration: gem5/configs/example/sst/riscv_fs.py
* System setup:
    * SST drives the simulation.
    * One gem5 component, which consists of 4 detailed cores.
    * Cache and memory are SST::Components from SST-Elements.

## gem5/SST Integration

* System setup:
    * SST drives the full-system simulation.
    * One gem5 component, which consists of 4 detailed cores.
    * Cache and memory are SST::Components from SST-Elements.
* Limitations:
    * gem5 cores wake up frequently per CPU clock tick.
    * The cores are frequently synchronized due to cache coherency protocol.
    * Needs work for block devices to work.

---

## gem5/SST Integration

* However, we can set up multiple-node simulation.
* How?
    * Having multiple gem5 components, each represents a node.
    * Each gem5 component is in a different partition.
    * Communication between gem5 instances can be done via gem5 PIO devices.
* Why?
    * There are more parallelism at the node granularity.

---

## Other Notes

* SST has its own Python environment, so gem5 within SST should not initialize the Python environment again.
* However, the m5 and gem5 libraries should be manually imported.
* m5 library has a function to find SimObject given a SimObject name.
    * Useful for finding the owner for a port in an external simulator.
