## Getting started with gem5

In this section, we will get familiar the tutorial's codespace environment and run our first gem5 simulation.

---

## Let’s hit the ground running

### This example will show

1. How someone obtains gem5.
2. How you build it.
3. Running a very basic "Hello World" simulation.

- Getting and compiling gem5 is often the hardest part.
- There's a lot of complicated things happening behind the scenes. We will explain them later.

---

## Typical Downloading

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/gem5/gem5
> cd gem5
```

> There are two main branches in the gem5 repository:
> **stable**: The default branch for gem5. Updated at stable releases. Currently v24.0.
> **develop**: The branch in which new features, improvements, etc. are added regularly for the next release.

In this tutorial we’re going to use codespaces with a repo which includes some example materials. Though all the gem5 code is v24.0

---

## Using codespaces

- We will be using the "bootcamp environment"
  - Note: That's also where the source for these slides are

> **Step 1:** Go to the classroom <https://classroom.github.com/...>

You need to be in the github organization (via the classroom) to get free codespaces.

---

## Using codespaces 2

**AFTER** joining the classroom, you can go to the repository and click on the green "Code" button.
Again, note that this is the repo where the slides are.

<https://github.com/gem5bootcamp-2024/>

## Using codespaces 3

> **Step 3:** Wait for the environment to load.

## Building gem5

```sh
> scons build/ALL/gem5.opt
```

- This takes a while (10-15 minutes with 16 cores, ~1hr on 1 core).
- If you're using codespaces, we have prebuilt binaries for you.
- We'll talk more about the build system and options later.

## Let’s start by writing a simulation configuration

```python
from gem5.prebuilt.demo.x86_demo_board import X86DemoBoard
from gem5.resources.resource import obtain_resource
from gem5.simulate.simulator import Simulator
```

This template code is available in the [materials/](/materials/...) directory.
Open the `materials/01-basic.py` file and start editing.

---

## Let’s be lazy and use a prebuild board

```python
board = X86DemoBoard()
```

The X86DemoBoard has the following properties:

- Single Channel DDR3, 2GB Memory.
- A 4 core 3GHz processor (using gem5’s ‘timing’ model).
- A MESI Two Level Cache Hierarchy, with 32kB data and instruction case and a 1MB L2 Cache.
- Will be run as a Full-System simulation.

Source is available: [src/python/gem5/prebuilt/demo/x86_demo_board.py](/src/python/gem5/prebuilt/demo/x86_demo_board.py).

---

## Let't load some software

```python
board.set_workload(
    obtain_resource("x86-ubuntu-24.04-boot-no-systemd")
)
```

- `obtain_resource` downloads the files needed to run workload
  - Boots Ubuntu without systemd then exits the simulation
  - Downloads disk image, kernel, and sets default parameters

See the [gem5 resource page](https://resources.gem5.org/resources/x86-ubuntu-24.04-boot-no-systemd?version=1.0.0)

---

## Now, let's create a simulator to actually run

```python
sim = Simulator(board)
sim.run(20_000_000_000) # 20 billion ticks or 20 ms
```

---

## That's it!

```python
from gem5.prebuilt.demo.x86_demo_board import X86DemoBoard
from gem5.resources.resource import obtain_resource
from gem5.simulate.simulator import Simulator
board = X86DemoBoard()
board.set_workload(
    obtain_resource("x86-ubuntu-24.04-boot-no-systemd")
)
sim = Simulator(board)
sim.run(20_000_000_000) # 20 billion ticks or 20 ms
```

To run it:

```sh
> gem5 materials/01-basic.py
```

## Take aways

- `gem5` is a Python interpreter.
- The *interface* to `gem5` is Python scripts.
- `gem5` contains many Python libraries.
  - All of the models in gem5 (e.g., caches, CPUs, etc.).
  - The standard library (stdlib)
- The output of gem5 is in `m5out/` by default.
  - Details of configuration
  - Other output
  - **Statistics** (the most important part)
- The codespaces environment is configured to make things easy.
  - You'll need to do some work to set up your own environment.
