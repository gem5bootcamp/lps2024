## Why simulation?

---

## Why simulation? (Answer)

- Need a tool to evaluate systems that don't exist (yet)
  - Performance, power, energy, etc.
- Very costly to actually make the hardware
- Computer systems are complex with many interdependent parts
  - Not easy to be accurate without the full system
- Simulation can be parameterized
  - Design-space exploration
  - Sensitivity analysis

---

## Alternatives to cycle-level simulation: Analytical modeling

### Amdahl's Law

$$ S_{latency}(s) = \frac{1}{(1-p) + \frac{p}{s}} $$

### Queuing theory

![Queuing theory bg auto](./01-simulation-background-imgs/queuing.png)

<br><br> <!-- needed for image above -->

$$ L = \lambda W $$

## Kinds of simulation

- Functional simulation
- Instrumentation-based
- Trace-based
- Execution-driven
- Full system

---

## Kinds of simulation: details

- Functional simulation
  - Executes programs correctly. Usually no timing information
  - Used to validate correctness of compilers, etc.
  - RISC-V Spike, QEMU, gem5 "atomic" mode
- Instrumentation-based
  - Often binary translation. Runs on actual hardware with callbacks
  - Like trace-based. Not flexible to new ISA. Some things opaque
  - PIN, NVBit
- Trace-based simulation
  - Generate addresses/events and re-execute
  - Can be fast (no need to do functional simulation). Reuse traces
  - If execution depends on timing, this will not work!
  - "Specialized" simulators for single aspect (e.g., just cache hit/miss)

---

## Kinds of simulation: Execution-driven and full system

### Execution-driven

- Functional and timing simulation is combined
- gem5 and many others
- gem5 is "execute in execute" or "timing directed"

### Full system

- Components modeled with enough fidelity to run mostly unmodified apps
- Often "Bare metal" simulation
- All of the program is functionally emulated by the simulator
- Often means running the OS in the simulator, not faking it

"Full system" simulators are often combine functional and execution-based

---

## Nomenclature (VMs)

- **Host:** the actual hardware you're using
- Running things directly on the hardware:
  - **Native execution**
- **Guest:** Code running on top of "fake" hardware
  - OS in virtual machine is guest OS
  - Running "on top of" hypervisor
  - Hypervisor is emulating hardware

---

## Nomenclature (gem5)

- **Host:** the actual hardware you're using
- **Simulator:** Runs on the host
  - Exposes hardware to the guest
- **Guest:** Code running on simulated hardware
  - OS running on gem5 is guest OS
  - gem5 is simulating hardware
- **Simulator's code:** Runs natively
  - executes/emulates the guest code
- **Guest's code:** (or benchmark, workload, etc.)
  - Runs on gem5, not on the host.

![layers of your system and of a virtualized system bg right:45% 90%](./01-simulation-background-imgs/gem5-nomenclature.drawio.svg)

---

## Nomenclature (more gem5)

- **Host:** the actual hardware you're using
- **Simulator:** Runs on the host
  - Exposes hardware to the guest
- **Simulator's performance:**
  - Time to run the simulation on host
  - Wallclock time as you perceive it
- **Simulated performance:**
  - Time predicted by the simulator
  - Time for guest code to run on simulator

![layers of your system and of a virtualized system bg right:45% 90%](./01-simulation-background-imgs/gem5-nomenclature.drawio.svg)

---

## Tradeoffs in types of simulation

- Development time: time to make the simulator/models
- Evaluation time: wallclock time to run the simulator
- Accuracy: How close is the simulator to real hardware
- Coverage: How broadly can the simulator be used?

![Table from Computer Architecture Performance Evaluation Methods](./01-simulation-background-imgs/tradeoffs.png)

---

## What level should we simulate?

- Ask yourself: What fidelity is required for this question?
  - Example: New register file design
  - Often, the answer is a mix.
- gem5 is well suited for this mix
  - Models with different fidelity
  - Drop-in replacements for each other

### "Cycle level" vs "cycle accurate"

---

## RTL simulation

- RTL: Register transfer level/logic
  - The "model" is the hardware design
  - You specify every wire and every register
  - Close to the actual ASIC
- This is "cycle accurate" as it should be the same in the model and in an ASIC
- Very high fidelity, but at the cost of configurability
  - Need the entire design
  - More difficult to combine functional and timing

---

## Cycle-_level_ simulation

- Models the system cycle-by-cycle
- Often "event-driven" (we'll see this soon)
- Can be highly accurate
  - Not the exact same cycle-by-cycle as the ASIC, but similar timing
- Easily parameterizeable
  - No need for a full hardware design
- Faster than cycle-accurate
  - Can "cheat" and functionally emulate some things

## gem5's software architecture

---

## Software architectures

![diagram of models, stdlib, and simulation control](./01-simulation-background-imgs/gem5-software-arch.drawio.svg)

---

## gem5 architecture: SimObject

### Model

This is the `C++` code in **`src/`**

### Parameters

Python code in **`src/`**
In SimObject declaration file

### Instance or Configuration

A particular choice for the parameters
In standard library, your extension, or python runscript

---

## Model vs parameter

- **Model:** The `C++` code that does the timing simulation
  - Generic
- Expose **parameters** to python
- Set **parameters** and connections in python

![Picture of Sunny Cove architecture from wikichip bg right fit](./01-simulation-background-imgs/Sunny_cove_block_diagram.png)

---

## Some nomenclature

### You can **_extend_** a model to model new things

In this case, you should _inherit_ from the object in C++

```cpp
class O3CPU : public BaseCPU
{
```

### You can **_specialize_** a model to model with specific parameters

In this case, you should _inherit_ from the object in Python

```python
class i7CPU(O3CPU):
    issue_width = 10
```

## gem5 architecture: Simulation

gem5 is a **_discrete event simulator_**

At each timestep, gem5:

1. Event at the head is dequeued
2. The event is executed
3. New events are scheduled

## Discrete event simulation example

![Example of discrete event simulation fit](./01-simulation-background-imgs/des-example-3.drawio.svg)

To model things that take time, schedule the _next_ event in the future (latency of current event).
Can call functions instead of scheduling events, but they occur _in the same tick_.

---

## Discrete event simulation

"Time" needs a unit
In gem5, we use a unit called "Tick"

Need to convert a simulation "tick" to user-understandable time
E.g., seconds

This is the global simulation tick rate
Usually this is 1 ps per tick or $10^{12}$ ticks per second

## gem5's main abstractions: Memory

### Memory requests

- **Ports** allow you to send requests and receive responses
- Ports are unidirectional (two types, request/response)
- Anything* with a Request port can be connected to any Response port
- More on this in [Ports and memory-based SimObjects](../03-Developing-gem5-models/04-ports.md)

![CPU talking to caches with ports](./01-simulation-background-imgs/abstractions-1.drawio.svg)

---

## gem5's main abstractions: CPU

### ISA vs CPU model

- ISAs and CPU models are orthogonal.
- Any ISA should work with any CPU model.
- "Execution Context" is the interface.
- More on this in [modeling cores](../03-Developing-gem5-models/05-modeling-cores.md)
