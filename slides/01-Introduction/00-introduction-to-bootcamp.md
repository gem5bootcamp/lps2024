## Our goals for the gem5 bootcamp

- Make gem5 less painful and flatten the learning curve
- Give you a vocabulary for asking questions​
- Provide a reference for the future​
- Give you material to take back and teach your colleagues

---

## How this is going to work

- We'll be going mostly top-down
  - First: How to use gem5
  - Second: How to each model can be used
  - Third: How to develop your own models and modify existing models
- Highly iterative:
  - You'll see the same thing over and over
  - Each time it will be one level deeper
- Lots of coding examples
  - Both live coding and practice problems
