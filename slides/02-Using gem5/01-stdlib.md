# gem5's Standard Library

---

# What is the standard library for?

- When done without the library you must define *every part* of your simulation
- This allows for maximum flexibility, but it can mean creating 100s of lines of python to create the most basic simulation

---

# Where to find stuff: Importing in a script

```python
from gem5.components import *
```
