- How to build gem5
 -->

## Let's begin by building gem5

Let's build gem5 in the base **gem5** directory while we go through some basics. Do it by running the following commands.

```sh
cd gem5
scons build/NULL/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

---

## Some Basics on gem5's build system

gem5's build system is *complicated*

As we'll see in the coming sections, gem5 has a number of domain-specific languages and source-to-source compilers.

This means two things:

1. It's not always obvious what the final code is going to look like
2. Setting up the gem5 is build has many, many options.

---

## Configuring the gem5 build

As we've seen, there are multiple ways to configure the gem5 build and this results in different binaries.

There are to categories of options:

1. Build-time configuration (e.g., what models to include in the binary)
2. Compiler configuration (e.g., optimizations, debug flags, etc.)

If you forget any of this

> `scons --help` will explain the targets and Kconfig tools.

---

## Compiler configuration

This is specified by the *suffix* of the gem5 binary you build. For example, `gem5.opt` is built with the "opt" configuration. The options are:

- `fast`: All optimizations, no debug symbols, most assertions are disabled.
  - Use this only after you have fully debugged your models.
  - Significant speedup over `opt` because the binary is smaller (~50 MiB)
- `opt`: Optimized build with debug symbols and all panics, assertions, etc. enabled.
  - This is the most common build target, but it's very large (~500 MiB)
  - Can use this with `gdb` but sometimes it will say "that variable is optimized away"
- `debug`: Minimal optimizations (`-O1`) and all debug symbols.
  - Use this when you need to debug the gem5 code itself and `opt` doesn't work for you.
  - *Much, much* slower than `opt` (order 5-10x slower)

> Remember, these options are for the *gem5* binary, not the simulated system. Choosing *fast* or *debug* will not affect the output of the simulator (unless there are bugs, of course).

---

## Build-time configuration

There are many options for configuring the gem5 build.

Two ways to do this

1. Use the defaults found in `gem5/build_opts`
2. Configure with `Kconfig` (the same tool the Linux kernel uses)

---

## Build_opts

```text
ALL                       GCN3_X86                  NULL_MOESI_hammer  X86_MESI_Two_Level
ARM                       MIPS                      POWER              X86_MI_example
ARM_MESI_Three_Level      NULL                      RISCV              X86_MOESI_AMD_Base
ARM_MESI_Three_Level_HTM  NULL_MESI_Two_Level       SPARC
ARM_MOESI_hammer          NULL_MOESI_CMP_directory  VEGA_X86
Garnet_standalone         NULL_MOESI_CMP_token      X86
```

In `build_opts` you'll find a number of default options. Most of them are named `<ISA>_<PROTOCOL>`.

For example, `X86_MESI_Two_Level` is the build option for the X86 ISA and with the MESI_Two_Level protocol.

You can also build multiple ISAs into a single binary (e.g., `ALL`), but you **cannot** build multiple Ruby coherence protocols into one binary.

---

## Using Kconfig

Kconfig is a tool that allows you to configure the gem5 build interactively.

When using Kconfig, you first must create a build directory.
Note: This directory can have any name and live *anywhere* on your system.

Common practice is to create a directory called `build` in the gem5 source directory and to use a default from `build_opts`.

```sh
scons defconfig build/my_gem5/ build_opts/ALL
```

In this case, we are using `build/m5_gem5` as the build directory and `build_opts/ALL` as the default configuration.

---

## Using Kconfig (cont.)

Once you have created the build directory, you can run `scons` with the `menuconfig` target to get an interactive configuration tool.

```sh
scons menuconfig build/my_gem5/
```

<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/nMSV0wVOKNavHSJEt3I77jxyu.js" id="asciicast-nMSV0wVOKNavHSJEt3I77jxyu" async="true"></script>

---

## Putting it all together

To build gem5, once you have a build directory set up and configured, you can run the following command.

```sh
scons build/my_gem5/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

This will build the gem5 binary with the configuration you have set up.
It will build the "opt" binary.

Note: gem5 takes a long time to build, so using multiple cores is important.
I don't know how many cores you have, so I've used `-j$(nproc)` to use all of them.
You may want to use fewer cores if you're doing other things on your system.

---

## gem5's Scons build system

There are two main types of files used to set up gem5's build:

- `SConsctruct`: Contains definitions of types of build targets.
  - All of the `SConstruct` files are executed first.
  - Some code is also in `gem5/build_tools`
  - To be honest, this code is confusing and not easy to trace.
- `SConscript`: Contains the build instructions for a file.
  - Defines *what* to build (e.g., which C++ files to compile).
  - You will mostly interact with these files.

We support *most* common OSes and *most* modern compilers. Fixing compiler errors in the SCons build is not straightforward.

> We strongly encourage you to use **supported** compilers/OSes or use docker to build gem5.
>
> You will *not* find the SCons documentation helpful. gem5 has customized it *way* too much.

## SimObjects

 -->

## What is a SimObject?

`SimObject` is gem5's name for a simulated model. We use `SimObject` and its children classes (e.g. `ClockedObject`) to model computer hardware components. `SimObject` facilitates the following in gem5:

- Defining a model: e.g. a cache
- Parameterizing a model: e.g. cache size, associativity
- Gathering statistics: e.g. number of hits, number of accesses

## SimObject in Code

In a gem5 build, each `SimObject` based class has 4 related files.

- `SimObject` declaration file: Python(ish) script (.py extension):
  - Represents the model at the highest level. Allows instantiation of the model and interfacing with the C++ backend. It defines the sets of parameters for the model.
  - **CAUTION**: You should not change parameter values (which we will learn about in the future) in this file if what you want to do is to reconfigure your `SimObject`.
- `SimObject` header file: C++ header file (.hh extension):
  - Declares the `SimObject` class in C++.
  Strongly tied to `SimObject` definition file.
- `SimObject` source file: C++ source file (.cc extension):
  - Implements the `SimObject` functionalities.
- `SimObjectParams` header file: **Auto-generated** C++ header file (.hh) from `SimObject` definition:
  - Declares a C++ struct storing all the parameters of the `SimObject`.

<!-- _class: two-col -->

## HelloSimObject

We will start building our first `SimObject` called `HelloSimObject`, and we will look at one of the `SimObject` files.

We will start with the following steps.

1. Write a definition file.
2. Write a header file.
3. Write a source file.
4. Write a `SConscript`.
5. Compile.
6. Write a configuration script and run it.

###

Later, we'll do the following steps.

7. Add a parameter to the definition file.
8. Update the source file.
9. Compile.
10. Write a second configuration script and run it.

    - Creating a directory
    - Creating a new file
 -->

## SimObject Definition File: Creating the Files

Let's create a python file for our `SimObject` under:
[src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py)

Since gem5 is still compiling, start by opening a new terminal.

![width:1140px Where to click to open a new terminal](./01-sim-objects-intro-imgs/terminal.drawio.svg)

Then, run the following commands in the base **gem5** directory:

```sh
cd gem5
mkdir src/bootcamp
mkdir src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object
touch src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py
```

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- What to put in SimObject definition file
 -->

## SimObject Definition File: Importing and Defining

Open [src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py) in your editor of choice.

In `HelloSimObject.py`, we will define a new class that represents our `HelloSimObject`.
We need to import the definition of `SimObject` from `m5.objects.SimObject`.
Add the following line to `HelloSimObject.py` to import the definition for `SimObject`.

```python
from m5.objects.SimObject import SimObject
```

Let's add the definition for our new `SimObject`.

```python
class HelloSimObject(SimObject):
    type = "HelloSimObject"
    cxx_header = "bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh"
    cxx_class = "gem5::HelloSimObject"
```

---

<!--

    - What is
        - type
        - cxx_header
        - cxx_class
    - MetaSimObject metaclass
 -->

## SimObject Definition File: Deeper Look at What We Have Done

Let's take a deeper look at the few lines of code we have.

```python
class HelloSimObject(SimObject):
    type = "HelloSimObject"
    cxx_header = "bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh"
    cxx_class = "gem5::HelloSimObject"
```

- `type` is the type name for the `SimObject` in python.
- `cxx_header` denotes the path to the C++ header file that declares the `SimObject` in C++. **IMPORTANT**: This path should be specified relative to `gem5/src`.
- `cxx_class` is the name of your `SimObject` class in C++.

`type`, `cxx_header`, and `cxx_class` are keywords defined by the `MetaSimObject` metaclass. For a complete list of these keywords, look at [src/python/m5/SimObject::MetaSimObject](../../gem5/src/python/m5/SimObject.py). Some (if not all) of these keyword variables can be skipped. However, I strongly encourage you to at least define `type`, `cxx_header`, `cxx_class`.

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Important Notes
    - Naming consistency
    - autogenerated params header file
 -->

## Word to the Wise and A Little Peek into the Future

- I strongly recommend setting `type` to the name of the `SimObject` class in Python. I also recommend making sure that the C++ class name is the same as the Python class. You will see throughout the gem5 codebase that this is *not* always the case. However, I strongly recommend following this rule to rid yourself of any compilation headaches.

- We will see later that, when gem5 is built, there will be an **auto-generated** struct definition that stores the parameters of that class. The name of the struct will be determined by the name of the `SimObject` itself. For example, if the name of the `SimObject` is `HelloSimObject`, the struct storing its parameters will be `HelloSimObjectParams`. This definition will be in a file under [params/HelloSimObject.hh](../../gem5/build/NULL/params/HelloSimObject.hh) in the build directory. This struct is used when instantiating an object of a `SimObject` in C++.

<!-- An object of a SimObject class? -->

 -->

## SimObject Header File: Creating the Files

Now, let's start building our `SimObject` in C++. First, let's create a file for our `SimObject` by running the following commands in the base **gem5** directory. **REMEMBER**: We set `cxx_header` to `bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh`. Therefore, we need to add the definition for `HelloSimObject` in a file with that same path.

<!-- need to add the declaration? -->

```sh
touch src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh
```

**VERY IMPORTANT**: If a `SimObject` class inherits from another `SimObject` class in Python, it should do the same in C++. For example, `HelloSimObject` inherits from `SimObject` in Python, so in C++, `HelloSimObject` should inherit from `SimObject`.
**VERY IMPORTANT**: `SimObject` parameter structs are inherited in the same way as the `SimObject` itself. For example, if `HelloSimObject` inherits from `SimObject`, `HelloSimObjectParams` inherits from `SimObjectParams`

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## SimObject Header File: First Few Lines

Open [src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh) in your editor of choice and add the following code to it.

```cpp
#ifndef __BOOTCAMP_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HH__
#define __BOOTCAMP_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HH__

#include "params/HelloSimObject.hh"
#include "sim/sim_object.hh"

namespace gem5
{

class HelloSimObject: public SimObject
{
  public:
    HelloSimObject(const HelloSimObjectParams& params);
};

} // namespace gem5

#endif // __BOOTCAMP_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HH__
```

---

<!--

    - double includes/cyclic includes
- sim/sim_object.hh
- namespace gem5
    - specific namespaces
- HelloSimObject inherits from SimObject
- SimObject constructor

 -->

## SimObject Header File: Deeper Look into the First Few Lines

Things to note:

<!-- - `sim/sim_object.hh` holds the definition for class `SimObject` in C++.
Should this be declaration? -->

- `__BOOTCAMP_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HELLO_SIM_OBJECT_HH__` is an include guard to prevent double includes and cyclic includes. gem5's convention is that the name should reflect the location of the header file relative to the `gem5/src` directory, with `_` being the separator.
- `sim/sim_object.hh` holds the definition for class `SimObject` in C++.
- As mentioned previously, `params/HelloSimObject.hh` is auto-generated and declares a struct named `HelloSimObjectParams`.
- Every `SimObject` should be declared/defined inside the `namespace gem5`. Different categories of `SimObjects` may have their own specific namespace such as `gem5::memory`.
- Class `HelloSimObject` (C++ counterpart for `HelloSimObject` in Python) should inherit from class `SimObject` (C++ counterpart for `SimObject` in Python).
- Every `SimObject` class needs to define a constructor that takes exactly one argument. This argument must be a constant reference object of its parameter struct. Later on, we will look at gem5's internal process that instantiates objects from `SimObject` classes.

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Creating and writing source file
 -->

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## SimObject Source File: All the Code

Let's create a source file for `HelloSimObject` under:
[src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc).

```sh
touch src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc
```

Open [src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc) in your editor of choice and add the following code to it.

```cpp
#include "bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh"

#include <iostream>

namespace gem5
{

HelloSimObject::HelloSimObject(const HelloSimObjectParams& params):
    SimObject(params)
{
    std::cout << "Hello from HelloSimObject's constructor!" << std::endl;
}

} // namespace gem5
```

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Include statement convention
- Constructors we defined
- Explain params object in the context of HelloSimObject
-->

<!-- In the last bullet point: I don't fully understand this line: This means params can be passed to the `SimObject::SimObject`
It can be passed to SimObject::SimObject because it inherits from SimObjectParams? It needs to be passed to SimObjectParams because of the nature of inheritance? Why do we need to pass to SimObject? -->

## SimObject Source File: Deeper Look

Things to note:

- gem5's convention for the order of include statements is as follows.
  - the header for the `SimObject`.
  - C++ libraries in alphabetical order.
  - other gem5 header files in alphabetical order.
- We only define `HelloSimObject's` constructor since that's the only function it has so far.
- The `params` object passed to the `HelloSimObject::HelloSimObject` constructor is an object of `HelloSimObjectParams` which inherits from `SimObjectParams`. This means `params` can then be passed on to the `SimObject::SimObject` constructor.

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Why we need a SConscript
- Creating and writing a Sconscript
-->

## Let's Start Building: SConscript

We need to register our `SimObject` with gem5 for it to be built into the gem5 executable. At build time, `scons` (gem5's build system) will look through the gem5 directory searching for files named `SConscript`. `SConscript` files include instructions on what needs to be built. We will simply create a file called `SConscript` (inside our `SimObject` directory) by running the following command in the base **gem5** directory.

```sh
touch src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/SConscript
```

Add the following to the [SConscript](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/SConscript).

```python
Import("*")

SimObject("HelloSimObject.py", sim_objects=["HelloSimObject"])

Source("hello_sim_object.cc")
```

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Go through each line of SConscript
    - Import("*")
    - SimObject("HelloSimObject.py", sim_objects=["HelloSimObject"])
    - Source("hello_sim_object.cc")
-->

## Let's Start Building: Deeper Look at the SConscript

Things to note:

- `SimObject("HelloSimObject.py", sim_objects=["HelloSimObject"])` registers `HelloSimObject` as a `SimObject`. The first argument denotes the name of the submodule that will be created under `m5.objects`. All the `SimObjects` listed under `sim_objects` will be added to that submodule. In this example, we will be able to import `HelloSimObject` as `m5.objects.HelloSimObject.HelloSimObject`. It is possible to define more than one `SimObject` in one Python script. Only `SimObjects` listed under `sim_objects` will be built.
- `Source("hello_sim_object.cc")` adds `hello_sim_object.cc` as a source file to be compiled.

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Recompile gem5
- Creating directories and configuration script file path
 -->

## Let's Compile

Now, the only thing left to do before we can use `HelloSimObject` in our configuration script is to recompile gem5. Run the following command in the base **gem5** directory to recompile gem5.

```sh
scons build/NULL/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

While we wait for gem5 to build, we will create a configuration script that uses `HelloSimObject`. In a separate terminal, let's create that script inside [gem5/configs](../../gem5/configs/). First, let's create a directory structure for our scripts. Run the following set of commands in the base **gem5** directory to create a clean structure.

```sh
mkdir configs/bootcamp
mkdir configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object
touch configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/first-hello-example.py
```

<!-- Might be worth mentioning the device tree earlier or dedicating a slide to it -->

## Configuration Script: First Hello Example: m5 and Root

Open [configs/bootcamp/first-hello-example.py](../../gem5/configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/first-hello-example.py) in your editor of choice.

To run a simulation, we will need to interface with gem5's backend. `m5` will allow us to call on the C++ backend to instantiate `SimObjects` in C++ and simulate them. To import `m5` into your configuration script, add the following to your code.

```python
import m5
```

Every configuration script in gem5 has to instantiate an object of class `Root`. This object represents the root of the device tree in the computer system that gem5 is simulating. To import `Root` into your configuration, add the following line to your script.

```python
from m5.objects.Root import Root
```

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Importing HelloSimObject
- Creating device tree in code
 -->

## Configuration Script: First Hello Example: Creating Instances in Python

We will also need to import `HelloSimObject` into our configuration script. To do that, add the following line to your configuration script.

```python
from m5.objects.HelloSimObject import HelloSimObject
```

The next thing we need to do is create a `Root` object and a `HelloSimObject` object. We can just add our `HelloSimObject` object as a child of the `root` object by using the `.` operator. Add the following lines to your configuration to do that.

```python
root = Root(full_system=False)
root.hello = HelloSimObject()
```

**NOTE**: We are passing `full_system=False` to `Root` because we are going to simulate in `SE` mode.

---

<!--

- m5.simulate()
- getCause()
 -->

## Configuration Script: First Hello Example: Instantiation in C++ and Simulation

Next, let's tell gem5 to instantiate our `SimObjects` in C++ by calling `instantiate` from `m5`. Add the following line to your code to do that.

```python
m5.instantiate()
```

Now that we have instantiated our `SimObjects`, we can tell gem5 to start the simulation. We do that by calling `simulate` from `m5`. Add the following line to your code to do that.

```python
exit_event = m5.simulate()
```

At this point, the simulation will start. It will return an object that holds the status of the simulation. We can see why the simulation exits by calling `getCause` from `exit_event`. Add the following line to your code to due that.

```python
print(f"Exited simulation because: {exit_event.getCause()}.")
```

---

<!--

## Everything Everywhere All at Once

Here is the complete version of our configuration script.

```python
import m5
from m5.objects.Root import Root
from m5.objects.HelloSimObject import HelloSimObject

root = Root(full_system=False)
root.hello = HelloSimObject()

m5.instantiate()
exit_event = m5.simulate()

print(f"Exited simulation because: {exit_event.getCause()}.")
```

## A Little Bit of a Detour: m5.instantiate

<!--
Speaker Notes
- What happens when m5.instantiate() is called
    - SimObjects created
    - Ports
 -->

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## Detour: m5.instantiate: SimObject Constructors and Connecting Ports

Below is a snippet of code from the definition of `m5.instantiate`:

```python
# Create the C++ sim objects and connect ports
    for obj in root.descendants():
        obj.createCCObject()
    for obj in root.descendants():
        obj.connectPorts()
```

When you call `m5.instantiate`, first, all the `SimObjects` are created (i.e. their C++ constructors are called). Then, all the `port` connections are created. If you don't know what a `Port` is, don't worry. We will get to that in the later slides. For now, think of `ports` as a facility for `SimObjects` to send each other data.

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- What happens when m5.instantiate() is called
    - init (for all SimObjects)
 -->


<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## Detour: m5.instantiate: SimObject::init

Here is a later snippet of code in `instantiate`.

```python
    # Do a second pass to finish initializing the sim objects
    for obj in root.descendants():
        obj.init()
```

In this step, gem5 will call the `init` function from every `SimObject`. `init` is a virtual function defined by the `SimObject` class. Every `SimObject` based class can override this function. The purpose of the `init` function is similar to the constructor. However, it is guaranteed that when the `init` function from any `SimObject` is called, all the `SimObjects` are created (i.e. their constructors are called).

Below is the declaration for `init` in `src/sim/sim_object.hh`.

```cpp
    /* init() is called after all C++ SimObjects have been created and
    *  all ports are connected.  Initializations that are independent
    *  of unserialization but rely on a fully instantiated and
    *  connected SimObject graph should be done here. */
    virtual void init();
```

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- What happens when m5.instantiate() is called
    - checkpoints (explain in depth)
    - initState and loadState
 -->

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## Detour: m5.instantiate: SimObject::initState, SimObject::loadState

Below shows another snippet from instantiate:

```python
# Restore checkpoint (if any)
    if ckpt_dir:
        _drain_manager.preCheckpointRestore()
        ckpt = _m5.core.getCheckpoint(ckpt_dir)
        for obj in root.descendants():
            obj.loadState(ckpt)
    else:
        for obj in root.descendants():
            obj.initState()
```

`initState` and `loadState` are the last step of initializing `SimObjects`. However, only one of them is called for every simulation. `loadState` is called to unserialize a `SimObject's` state from a checkpoint and `initState` is only called when starting a new simulation (i.e. not from a checkpoint).

Continued in next page.

## Detour: m5.instantiate: SimObject::initState, SimObject::loadState: C++

Below is the declaration for `initState` and `loadState` in `src/sim/sim_object.hh`.

```cpp
    /* loadState() is called on each SimObject when restoring from a
    *  checkpoint.  The default implementation simply calls
    *  unserialize() if there is a corresponding section in the
    *  checkpoint.  However, objects can override loadState() to get
    *  other behaviors, e.g., doing other programmed initializations
    *  after unserialize(), or complaining if no checkpoint section is
    *  found. */
    virtual void loadState(CheckpointIn &cp);
    /* initState() is called on each SimObject when *not* restoring
    *  from a checkpoint.  This provides a hook for state
    *  initializations that are only required for a "cold start". */
    virtual void initState();
```

## We Will See Later

You might have noticed that we also call `m5.simulate` in our configuration script. For now, `HelloSimObject` does nothing interesting during simulation. We will look into the details of simulate later.

-->

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## Let's Talk About Params: Model vs Params

<!-- ask Jason for good example analogy for Model vs Params (cache is a model and cache size is a param) -->

As we mentioned earlier, gem5 allows us to parameterize our models. The whole set of parameter classes in gem5 is defined under `m5.params`, so let's go ahead and import everything from `m5.params` into our `SimObject` definition file. Open [src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py) in your editor of choice and add the following line to it.

```python
from m5.params import *
```

Now we just need to define a parameter for our `HelloSimObject`. Add the following line to the same file (the `HelloSimObject` definition) to do that. You should add this line under the definition of
`class HelloSimObject`.

```python
num_hellos = Param.Int("Number of times to say Hello.")
```

Make sure to take a look at [src/python/m5/params.py](../../gem5/src/python/m5/params.py) for more information on different parameter classes and how you can add a parameter.
**CAUTION**: `Params` allow you to define a default value for them. I strongly recommend that you don't define defaults unless you really have to.

- Final definition file

## HelloSimObject Definition File Now

Here is what your `HelloSimObject` definition file should look like after the changes.

```python
from m5.objects.SimObject import SimObject
from m5.params import *

class HelloSimObject(SimObject):
    type = "HelloSimObject"
    cxx_header = "bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh"
    cxx_class = "gem5::HelloSimObject"

    num_hellos = Param.Int("Number times to say Hello.")
```

**NOTE**: This change to `HelloSimObject.py` will now add an attribute to the `HelloSimObjectParams` the next time you compile gem5. This means that we can now access this parameter in the C++ code.

---

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Updating source file to use num_hellos
    - Explain that you are NOT replacing the ENTIRE file with this code (only updating the class)
- Recompile
-->

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## Using num_hellos

Now, we're going to use `num_hellos` to print `Hello from ...` multiple times in the constructor of the `HelloSimObject`. Open [src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc) in your editor of choice.

Change `HelloSimObject::HelloSimObject` like below:

```cpp
HelloSimObject::HelloSimObject(const HelloSimObjectParams& params):
    SimObject(params)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < params.num_hellos; i++) {
        std::cout << "i: " << i << ", Hello from HelloSimObject's constructor!" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

Make sure you don't delete `include` statments and any lines containing `namespace gem5`

***RECOMPILE***: All we need to do now is just recompile gem5. Simply do that by running the following command in the base **gem5** directory.

```sh
scons build/NULL/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
```

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Auto-generated param header file
-->

<!-- _class: two-col too-much-code -->

## params/HelloSimObject.hh

As we mentioned before, the parameters of a `SimObject` are defined in an auto-generated header file with the `SimObject's` name.

Now that we have added a parameter to `HelloSimObject`, it should now be defined under `HelloSimObjectParams` in [build/NULL/params/HelloSimObject.hh](../../gem5/build/NULL/params/HelloSimObject.hh).

If you look at the header file, you should see something like this.

###

```cpp
#ifndef __PARAMS__HelloSimObject__
#define __PARAMS__HelloSimObject__

namespace gem5 {
class HelloSimObject;
} // namespace gem5
#include <cstddef>
#include "base/types.hh"

#include "params/SimObject.hh"

namespace gem5
{
struct HelloSimObjectParams
    : public SimObjectParams
{
    gem5::HelloSimObject * create() const;
    int num_hellos;
};

} // namespace gem5

#endif // __PARAMS__HelloSimObject__
```

<!--
Speaker Notes
- Creating a new configuration script
- Adding param num_hellos
-->

<!-- _class: too-much-code -->

## Configuration Script: Second Hello Example

Let's create a copy of [first-hello-example.py](../../gem5/configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/first-hello-example.py) named [second-hello-example.py](../../gem5/configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/second-hello-example.py). Just run the following command in the base **gem5** directory to do this.

```sh
cp configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/first-hello-example.py configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/second-hello-example.py
```

Now, open [second-hello-example.py](../../gem5/configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/second-hello-example.py) in your editor of choice and change the code so that it passes a value for `num_hellos` when you instantiate a `HelloSimObject`. Below is a full example of this.

```python
import m5
from m5.objects.Root import Root
from m5.objects.HelloSimObject import HelloSimObject

root = Root(full_system=False)
root.hello = HelloSimObject(num_hellos=5)

m5.instantiate()
exit_event = m5.simulate()

print(f"Exited simulation because: {exit_event.getCause()}.")
```

## Summary of Steps

- Creating a basic `SimObject`
    - [`SimObject` definition file](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py) (.py)
        - Defines the sets of parameters for the model.
    - [`SimObject` header file](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.hh) (.hh)
        - Declares the `SimObject` class in C++.
    - [`SimObject` source file](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc) (.cc extension):
        - Implements the `SimObject` functionalities.
    - [`SConscript`](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/SConscript)
        -  Register our `SimObject` with gem5.
    - Auto-generated [`SimObjectParams` header file](../../gem5/build/NULL/params/HelloSimObject.hh) (.hh)
        - Declares a C++ struct storing all the parameters of the `SimObject`.
    - [Configuration file](../../gem5/configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/first-hello-example.py) (.py)
        - Instantiate `SimObject` and run the simulation.
- Adding a parameter (`num_hellos`)
    - Update the [definition file](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/HelloSimObject.py) and the [source file](../../gem5/src/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/hello_sim_object.cc).
    - Write a new [configuration file](../../gem5/configs/bootcamp/hello-sim-object/second-hello-example.py).
    - Re-compile and re-run.
